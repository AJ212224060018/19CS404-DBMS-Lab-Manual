# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a query to display all the customers whose ID is the difference between the salesperson ID of Mc Lyon and 2001.
salesman table

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id = (
    (SELECT salesman_id FROM salesman WHERE name = 'Mc Lyon') - 2001
);

```

**Question 2**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find salespeople who had more than one customer. Return salesman_id and name.
salesman table
```sql
SELECT s.salesman_id, s.name
FROM salesman s
JOIN customer c
  ON s.salesman_id = c.salesman_id
GROUP BY s.salesman_id, s.name
HAVING COUNT(c.customer_id) > 1;

```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the medications with dosages equal to the lowest dosage

Table Name: Medications (attributes: medication_id, medication_name, dosage)

```sql
SELECT medication_id, medication_name, dosage
FROM Medications
WHERE dosage = (
    SELECT MIN(dosage)
    FROM Medications
);

```

**Output:**

**Question 4**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find the order values greater than the average order value of 10th October 2012. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.

Note: date should be yyyy-mm-dd format

```sql
SELECT ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id
FROM orders
WHERE purch_amt > (
    SELECT AVG(purch_amt)
    FROM orders
    WHERE ord_date = '2012-10-10'
);

```

**Output:**

**Question 5**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.

Sample table: GRADES (attributes: student_id, student_name, subject, grade)

```sql
SELECT student_name, grade
FROM Grades g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MAX(grade)
    FROM Grades
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);

```

**Output:**

<img width="1039" height="409" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ab21307-0b53-4899-82b2-256f128c4979" />


**Question 6**
---
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $4500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 4500;

```

**Output:**

<img width="1199" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8a25016-6d0b-465b-80cd-31f50e03f6b0" />


**Question 7**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to determine the commission of the salespeople in Paris. Return commission.
salesman table

```sql
SELECT commission
FROM salesman
WHERE salesman_id IN (
  SELECT salesman_id
  FROM customer
  WHERE city = 'Paris'
);

```

**Output:**

<img width="847" height="309" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01e3adba-cac9-4804-80ba-c5ea07a13858" />


**Question 8**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all orders generated by the salespeople who may work for customers whose id is 3007. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.

Table Name: orders

```sql
SELECT ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id
FROM orders
WHERE salesman_id = (
    SELECT salesman_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE customer_id = 3007
);

```

**Output:**

<img width="1240" height="410" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d083a0dd-6822-4798-9a1a-74367e32779e" />


**Question 9**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieve all the columns from the table "Grades", where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Grades g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MAX(grade)
    FROM Grades
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);

```

**Output:**
